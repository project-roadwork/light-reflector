# Contributing

## Licensing
**This section exists due to the file-level copyleft nature of the Mozilla Public License 2.0.**

*By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions may be redistributed and relicensed by this project under other open-source and/or open-content licenses in the future (such as Apache-2.0).*

### Why?
**I may plan on relicensing this project into a permissive (less restrictive) open-source license such as the Apache License 2.0 in the future. If most people seem to be comfortable with the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (especially in game development), then relicensing would most likely not happen.**

## Platform
**You must submit your contributions on Codeberg since commits from GitHub CANNOT be merged into the main repository on GitHub.**

**You can also just sign into Codeberg via GitHub.**



## Feedback
**If you have any issues with the above statements, open an issue on Codeberg and explain your concerns.**
