# Code of Conduct
**Note: This code of conduct is designed to provide: a) a simple, easy to understand, minimal code of conduct without ambiguity.**

## Scope
**This code of conduct applies to on-topic development channels of the project. This
includes but is not limited to:**
- Bug trackers
- Development repositories
- Mailing lists
- Non-development platforms if misbehavior is also applicable to development channels
- Any other communication method for development of software

**Moderator actions are final in development channels.**

## Standards of Communication

**We expect all individuals to stay on-topic whilst using development channels, and respect moderation decisions.**

**We will not accept the following:**

- Stalking and witchhunting
- Arguments, and off-topic debates
- [Ad hominems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)
- Attempts to flame, or otherwise derail communication
- Troll feeding

**Criticism must encompass code, design, or implementation—not individuals.**

**Enforcement:** *First Warning -> Second Warning -> Temporary Ban -> Permanent Ban*

***If you see misbehavior, ignore the person(s) and speak with a moderator or administrator in [Illinois_Roadbuff's Discord server](https://discord.gg/sd4XfAqNF9), or contact Illinois_Roadbuff directly via email: [< illinois_roadbuff@proton.me >](mailto:illinois_roadbuff@proton.me).***

We are here as human beings to contribute to the free, open source / open content world. Treat others with decency and respect. Beyond that, contribute freely in good faith.
